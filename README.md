Introduction
---------

The code that generates the decision tree is comprised of 2 main classes: Dataset and Node. The Dataset class largely concerns itself with handling and presenting input data, whereas the Node class is used to generate the representation of the decision tree.

Project Goals
---------

The goal of BitFridge is to provide user with new ways to make the ingredients they already have to eat.

#### Goals
The methods contained in this part of the Dataset class are related to the algorithm that generates an ID3 Decision Tree given a training set.

#### User Target
The methods contained in this part of the Dataset class are related to the algorithm that generates an ID3 Decision Tree given a training set.

#### Expected Outcome
The methods contained in this part of the Dataset class are related to the algorithm that generates an ID3 Decision Tree given a training set.
