Introduction
---------

We choose this project because usually people do not prepare or shop for the ingredients
before cooking for everyday needs. They tend to use the ingredients available at home.
Many people also do not remember their favourite recipe by heart, this could lead to
difficulty of finding the suitable recipe for the ingredients. With this app, worry no
more! You can just input all the ingredients you have and the website will find the
perfect recipe for you. The search could also be tailored to match each individual needs.
This app is also ideal for all college students who have limited ingredients for cooking. 

Project Goals
---------

The goal of BitFridge is to provide user with new ways to make the ingredients they already have to eat.

#### Goals


#### User Target
For people who do not shop often and prefer to use whatever ingredients they have. 

#### Expected Outcome
By the end of the semester, **BitFridge** is expected to be able to take a set of
ingredients provided by the user and return with a list of recipes that contain said
ingredients. **BitFridge** will also come with supporting features to help user find the
right recipe for them, ranging from recommended recipes to search filters.
